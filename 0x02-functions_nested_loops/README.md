0. Write a program tha prints *_putchar*, followed by a new line.
 - should return to 0

1. Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
 - prototype: **void print_alphabet(void)**
 - only use *_putchar*

2. Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
 - prototype: **void_print_alphabet_x10(void)**
 - only use *putchar*

3. Write a function that checks for lowercase character.
 - prototype: **int _islower(int c)**
 - return *1* if **c** is lowercase
 - return *0* otherwise

4. Write a function that checks for alphabetic character.
 - prototype: **int _isalpha(int c);**
 - return *1* if *c* is a letter, lowercase or uppercase
 - return *0* otherwise.

5. Write a function that prints the sign of a number.
 - prototype: **int print_sign(int n);**
 - return *1* and print *+* if *n* is greater than zero.
 - return *0* and prints *0* if *n* is zero.
 - return *-1* and prints *-* if *n* is less than zero.

6. Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
 - prototype: **int _abs(int)**

7. Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.
 - prototype: **int print_last_digit(int)**
 - return the value of the last digit

8. Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59
 - prototype: **void jack_bauer(void)**

9. Write a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.
 - prototype: **void times_table(void)**
 - format: see example

10. Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.
 - prototype: **int add(int, int);**

11. Write a function that prints all natural numbers from *n* *98*, followed by a new line.
 - prototype: **void print_to_98(int n);**
 - numbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space.
 - numbers should be printed in order.
 - the first printed number should be the number passed to your
 function.
 - the last printed number should be *98*.
 - use *#include <stdio.h>*.

**ADVANCED**

12. Write a function that prints the *n* times table, starting with
  *0*.
 - prototype: **void print_times_table(int n);**
 - if *n* is greater than *15* or less than *0* the function should not print anything.

13. If we list all the natural numbers bellow *10* that are multiples of *3* or *5*, we get *3*, *5*, *6*, and *9*. The sum of these multiples is *23*. Write a program that computes and prints the sum of all the multiple of *3* or *5* below *1024* (excluded), followd by a new line:
 - you are allowed to use the standard library

14. Write a program that prints the first *50* Fibonacci numbers, starting with *1* and *2*, followed by a new line.
 - the numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space.
 - use *#include <stdio.h>*
